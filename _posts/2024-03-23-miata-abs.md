# Plans for ABS in the Miata

> Just a heads up this is purly my own notes for me to refer back to at a later date. This may or may not be turned into a full post. Will also be written in blog style

I have a 1999 Mazda Miata CA Spec. this is a non ABS model. So I'm not only converting it to ABS but also upgrading from the factory ABS

Why not use the factory ABS?
This is because the factory ABS while it does work is known to be pretty mild and I've found many reviews stating its the bare minimum but lets be honest what ABS system in the early 2000s was decent?

So what ABS system am I using?
BMW MK.60 ABS - Known for grassroot motorsports as its *inexpensive* when comapired to the bosch motorsports ABS system that yeilds ~ $10,000 (Thats more than I paid for the miata in 2021)

## MK60 Specific Parts
Stealing some info I've found on [TrackTuned.com](https://www.tracktuned.com/feed/mk60absswapguide) who installed an MK.60 unit into a 350z

Parts needed:

- MK60 ABS Unit  <br>Part Numbers with more aggressive calibration:
  <blockquote>  
    ATE 10.0960-813.3: E46 M3
    <br> ATE 10.0960-818.3: E46 M3
    <br> ATE 10.0960-817.3: E46 M3 CSL
</blockquote>
<h6><s>There are two variants of MK60 units that were fitted to the E46 M3 that can be used with the 3DM Motorsports standalone harness; part number 34512282558 (units fitted to 2003-2006 M3’s EXCEPT ZCP and CSL models) and 34512282421 (for the ZCP/CSL package cars).</s> 
  
At the time of writing this 3/23/34 3D Motorsports no longer offers their wiring harness on their website. I haven't tried to contact them as I already had planned building on my own harness. </h6>
<h6>
Any E46 M3 MK60 ABS unit will work if making your own harness. The units with the computer **part numbers ending in 813.3 supposedly can be programmed to a ‘race’ setup.**

Another Post by [mck11117](https://rusefi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2454) goes into detail "*The 813.3 and 817.3 are flashable to the motorsport firmware.* BMW considers the 813.3 and 818.3 to be the same, as they're interchangeable as far as they were concerned on a factory M3. It's not known how common the 813.3 is vs. the 818.3. All M3 controllers can be reconfigured to use the CSL parameters."
</h6>

-  MK60 Yaw Sensor
-  2x MK60 Pressure sensors
-  MK60 Wiring harness connectors (Ideally just cut the OEM harness with at least 12” of leads)
-  Heat shrink, solder seal wire connectors, fuses, 2.7k resistor, etc (details below)
-  Fittings/Adapters to connect OEM lines to ABS unit (details below)

Thank you to [TrackTuned.com](https://www.tracktuned.com/feed/mk60absswapguide) for the parts list. While I don't know how much this list will apply to me and my configuration It is a helpful step
so what I need just for the MK.60 unit is. 

- MK60 ABS Unit with part number ending in 813.3 (need to research this "race" setup)
- MK60 Yaw Sensor
- 2x MK60 Pressure Sensors
- MK60 Wiring Harness Connectors (will be soldering my own wires onto this) (Could possibly repin this as well for a cleaner install, depending on my budgets)

## Parts for the Miata

Since my miata doesn't have factory ABS rings I will be needing to either get OEM ABS rings off a junkyard NB or find new hubs. Im choosing to go with the ladder and get new hubs from [miatahubs](https://www.miatahubs.com) While these hubs are highly priced I feel they are defenitly worth it as the OEM miata hubs are known to break under the pressures of the track even with stock power (I am stock power at the time of writing this). Now the next task... 

### Wheel Speed Sensors

Getting right into it I'm considering installing OEM ABS knucles for the car as I already have plans to coat the whole suspesion system in POR-15 while also updating bushings with supermiatas bushing set. (I got these when they orginaly release in 2020ish maybe 2021 and haven't yet installed them) but anyways since i'd already have my whole suspesion apart what's the difficulty of swapping the knucles on my miata?

it looks like the MK60 unit can use any active speed sensors for its ABS system. the OEM miata abs sensors are active. (this is know by the 2 pin connector instead of a 3 pin connector)

While I was looking into this I found a helpful post on the [Miata Turbo Fourms](https://www.miataturbo.net/haltech-118/%5Bhow-%5D-vss-abs-sensor-na-nb-107705/) for using the factory miata ABS sensors as a wheel speed sensors for the haltech ECU (Im using the Haltech 1500 ECU)
