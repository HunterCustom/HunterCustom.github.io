# 60k Maintenance, Cooling Upgrades, New Tires, and Alignment 
Tackling a very large job fo rmy as a first time DIY mechanic

## Maintence Time
After a fun little drive to the abandoned mill factory, I hit 60k miles on my 23-year-old car. Figured it was time for some maintenance to freshen her up. Unsure of my exact plans for the car yet, I decided to prioritize reliability before any modifications.

Inspired by the latest video from the Miata Dad himself, I followed the guide he provided and purchased all the recommended parts from Treasure Coast Miata for about $550.

I'll admit, I was nervous about tackling this job. The most I'd ever DIY'd on a car before was my own oil change, and now I'm diving into tasks like the timing belt, new engine seals, and valve cover gaskets. But where better to learn than at my mechanic job, right? Thankfully, my boss allowed me to use a spare garage bay during my lunch breaks and a few hours on Saturdays, free of charge.

disassembling the front of the engine. The process went surprisingly smoothly. Managing the water hoses turned out to be relatively straightforward; I utilized a razor and a spreader tool effectively. Fortunately, I encountered no rust issues to complicate matters. Eventually, I successfully disassembled everything and began the process of replacing parts.

For maintenance purposes, I meticulously replaced several crucial components:

> Gates Water Pump
\
Gates Timing Belt Kit
\
OEM Water Tubing
\
Conducted an Oil Change
\
New Coolant
\
Fitted a New Harmonic Balancer

Each step required careful attention to detail, but with patience and diligence, I managed to complete the tasks at hand.

## Cooling Upgrades
So, to up the cool factor on my Miata's cooling game, I figured I'd go with the crowd favorite and slap on the SuperMiata Coolant Reroute along with the SuperMiata CFS Radiator. I mean, why not, right? With these bad boys working together, I'm expecting some serious chill vibes under the hood, no matter what kind of heat I throw at it. Just hoping it'll keep things breezy and smooth, whether I'm cruising down the highway or tearing it up on the track.

## New Wheels and Tires!
