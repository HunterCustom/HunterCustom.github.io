# New Seat, Better Lap Times?

After three years of searching for a seat that would suit me and fit into the Miata, I finally found the Sparco QRT-R. But now comes the bigger challenge: How do I mount it? I'm all for modifying and bashing the transmission tunnel a bit to make the new seat mounts fit, but my father wasn't keen on the idea. We tried to find a seat mount that would work for the QRT-R and fit into the factory mounting area.

After the last event with Gorman Performance and riding in Jacob's BRZ, I realized how much the OEM seats were holding me back. I had to sacrifice foot movement, braking, and input times just to keep myself in the seat without being thrown in every possible direction. So, I decided to go for it and bought the Sparco QRT-R with the PCI Adjustable Seat mount for my Miata from Fab9tuning.

After only about a week or two, I got the parts (today, actually, 5/1/24) and started working on installing the new seat right away. Here's my process of getting this seat in.
