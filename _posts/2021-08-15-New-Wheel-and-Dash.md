# OEM+ Upgrades | New Gauge Cluster, New Steering Wheel, and New Airbag

## The Steering Wheel
As Seen in the image below, the OEM steering Wheel and Dash we're in very good condition for a car from 1999 and having been in an accident. however I wasn't a huge fan of the look, I wanted something a little more modernized, I ended finding a really nice looking steering wheel online, this is the [ChiperAuto](https://cipherauto.com/collections/steering-wheels/products/enhanced-steering-wheel-for-mazda-miata-nb-leather-with-silver-stitching) NB steering Wheel

Changing the steering wheel seemed like a major task, and I'll admit, I didn't know what I was getting into. But surprisingly, it turned out to be a whole lot easier than I thought. After removing the steering column cover (which was just three screws), I had to deal with two bolts holding the airbag on. Then, using a 22mm socket on my impact gun, I was able to break the steering wheel bolt loose and remove it without any issues. Next, to get the OEM wheel off, I had to give the edges of the wheel a few solid hits. However, in my enthusiasm, I accidentally hit a bit too hard and ended up ripping off the connector to the clock spring. So, in addition to the new steering wheel, the car also got a shiny new clock spring. Sometimes, a little DIY adventure can lead to unexpected upgrades!

## Chsnging the Dash
I also wanted to change the dash color from the ugly factory green light to a sleek cool white, and I stumbled upon a website called [revlimiter](https://revlimiter.net). The owner over at revlimiter is a really cool guy and does a lot of work in the Miata community, so I was stoked to make a purchase from him. 
After browsing through the wide selection on his website, I was torn between the GT-40 and the Revolver Gauges. Ultimately, I decided to go with the Revolver set because I felt it had that perfect OEM+ vibe and looked like something that would come straight from the factory if the car were produced today.

### Almost Done
As seen below, the new steering wheel and dash looked great together. However, I felt that the OEM Nardio logo airbag seemed a bit outdated for this steering wheel. Consequently, I visited a local junkyard where I found a wrecked 2003 Mazda Protege. I retrieved the airbag from that car and installed it into the Miata, and the result is stunning.
