# Engine is Blown

Well, during Pat Gorman's Autumn Apex 2.0, unfortunately, the Miata's engine did not survive and blew up. Why? I am unsure at this time, but I will update when I can. As of 10/13/24, I have yet to pull the engine, as I am moving soon and don't have an engine hoist of my own. So, it looks like I'll be picking up a second job to help pay for the engine rebuild. Currently, the goal is 300whp, but the Miata is in winter storage until I can get the money to fix this.
