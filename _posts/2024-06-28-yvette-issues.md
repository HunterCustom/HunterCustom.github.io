# An Eventful Night Before Summer Showdown 2.0

Oh boy, this was the night before I was heading to the Summer Showdown 2.0. I went to bed early, but my parents were watching TV with the volume so loud that I could clearly make out the sound of the characters breathing. So, I closed my door. Well, as I was trying to sleep, my door got flung open and hit my open closet door, and my stepmom Yvette scurried away.

Now I'm lying in bed trying to sleep, and the TV is still at maximum volume. So, I decided to go into the living room and ask Yvette to turn down the TV, nothing snarky, just, "Hey, if I'm going to sleep with my door open, could you turn the TV down a bit? It's loud enough that I can hear the characters as if they're next to me." Yvette ignored me at first until my dad said her name. She looked at me with a dumb face and then said, "Oh yeah," and turned down the TV. I said thank you and went back to my room, turned on Do Not Disturb on my phone, and went to bed.

Then, at 12:45 AM, I woke up to my pillow being pulled from underneath me, someone running into my closet door, and clearly hearing whoever it was run to the master bedroom in the house. So, I grabbed my phone and went to turn on the flashlight but was greeted with these text messages:

![Yvette loves me](assets/img/IMG_5770.PNG) ![More love from Yvette](assets/img/IMG_5771.PNG).

This caused a mild panic attack for me, as I was scared to go back to bed and wanted to defend myself. So, I ended up talking to Lee, who was still up, and couldn't calm down until about 3 AM when I finally went to bed.

I woke up at 6 AM the next morning and just left the house, specifically not waking up the dog. I got in the Miata and left, had a really fun time at the event, and then instead of going home, I met up with my girlfriend Lee. While we were out and about, we noticed this damage to the Miata:

![Headlight](assets/img/74139789469__4BFC6688-DE27-428F-B0FD-C77E4988564F.fullsizerender.HEIC) ![Fender](assets/img/74139790694__DE32A206-13B4-4FF3-94FE-846707CFDCBF.fullsizerender.HEIC).

Yup, that's right, somebody keyed the Miata. But as someone who knows that car and every dent on it and when it occurred (yes, I'm insane), I found it really convenient that my Miata suddenly had a key mark on it after Yvette's shenanigans that night.

I mentioned to Dad that someone had keyed my car and that it wasn't there the night before. I also told him that I noticed it before I left. I didn't, but I already knew who keyed my car, especially considering I hadn't let the car out of my sight for the whole day and everyone I was around knows my car and who I am. But Yvette had told Dad that I had left the cameras off and she didn't notice until 11 PM at night, and the last clip before I turned off the cameras was at 10 PM. So, sometime within that one-hour period, "somebody" had walked down the driveway past multiple vehicles, just to scratch my Miata.

Dad, being an amazing dad, suggested we check the dashcams of our cars (something Yvette forgot about). Once he suggested that, I flew home and pulled my Chevy Cruze's dashcam only to find that it had recorded over itself already. So, I threw the SD card into a data recovery program just to see. Then, Lee and I left, went and watched *Inside Out 2*, and were on our way to get IHOP when Dad asked what time I was going to be home. I told him soon. He responded with, "Do not shut off the cameras," and this really pissed me off because I thought that meant he actually thought some random person had keyed my Miata. So, I raced home with full intent on destroying Yvette's life with all the evidence I had against her from the years and years of abuse she has put on me.

Once I got home, Dad asked me what kind of mood I was in, and I said so-so. He said okay. When I was upstairs, Yvette was on her couch and Dad was on the one across from her. He sat me down and had told Yvette to tell him what she told me. This woman goes, "All day I've been having images flash in my head of me taking a knife to the Miata," in a much shakier tone and everything, but I couldn't care less. I'm sure she was faking. Then my dad, funny enough, showed me exactly what knife she had used because, as he was unloading the dishwasher, his brand new knife that was delivered days prior was bent. And I mean bent to the point where my dad, who is strong, couldn't bend it back.

Dad had told Yvette that he wanted her gone and out of our lives, which I was grateful for as I do not like Yvette and never have.

But a month later, she is still living with us. However, now I am only giving $200 a month for rent instead of $400. She still lives with us, and there is still alcohol inside the house, including the same alcohol she drank the night she keyed the Miata. I have been unable to find a decent place to live that I can both qualify for and afford, and the only way out is getting a better job. To do that, I need the CCNA, but studying for the CCNA takes a lot of my energy, and already just being at the house takes all my energy, especially when my parents are both drunk. This has spun me into a slight depression, and at this time right now, I am avoiding it by working on improving my headlights, fixing a 3D printer to use for the headlights, and attempting to pay off my debt faster, though I've quit the Nintendo Switch modding aspect of my income, so now my income has lowered a lot.

I feel that nobody I talk to about it understands the energy drain that I have when I am home, as people have told me I just need to force myself to do better.

But yeah, at the end of the day, Yvette still lives with us and drinks, but so does my dad, who treats her like shit. And I won't lie, she deserves to get treated like shit, and I wish she had been kicked out.

But the Miata's headlight is going to cost $280-$300 to replace, and to have my fender repainted will cost another $450+ to replace. Yvette is doing everything she can to not pay for the damages to my car. Oh, and I guess Dad gave her $1500, and she instantly went to the casino with that money. But you know, she still complains that she can't afford things and gets pissy whenever I buy $100 worth of parts and tools every couple of weeks when I have the money.

**Final Message:**

**Fuck you, Yvette**, you're a horrible person, and I cannot believe I felt enough pity for you to not have you arrested for vandalizing my Miata, especially because everyone knows how much that car means to me. You better pay me the money to fix the car. I'm simply giving you temporary time to get some of the bills paid down as I do think a $640 electric bill is outrageous, and I know you got some fucked-up teeth.
