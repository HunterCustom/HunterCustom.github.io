# Miata Finally Gets Offical Number Magnets
I've officially gotten number magnets for my Miata, now sporting its known number of 299. After owning the car for four years (I can't believe it's been that long!), it feels great to add this personal touch. Fun fact: the number 299 is a combination of my birth year, 2002, and the Miata's year, 1999.
