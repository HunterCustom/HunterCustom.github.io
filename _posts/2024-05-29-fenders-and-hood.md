## 70k Oil Change
I won't lie the title of this makes it sound as if I only change the oil every 10k miles. I don't this was actully a 3,500 mile oil change I always change it every 5k miles or after every winter storage. in this case Winter storage came first
I also use full Synthetic oil 5w-30, now onto my bigger issue ✨Rust Prevention✨

# Rust Prevention
70k miles and 3 years of ownership and i've never checked the fender wells for dirt or other deberies. Following my friend Cash's videos form CashedOutCars on youtube I got the idea for this from him. 
Now the orgianl plan was to only pull the bottom of the fenders out and I had no intention of fully removing the fenders. ANyways I fully removed the fender <br>

once I had the driver side off I was more than happy to take off the passenger side as well. I don't even care even with the fenders off the car is still very attractive to me, though we'll have to do something about those headlights soon.

This is the surprising ammunt of dirt that came out of the driver side fender. Along with a headlight bulb and a flashlight, neither of witch were mine lol.

Surprisingly the driver side fender had a fair ammount of rust starting while the passenger barley had any. still rust isnt a thing I strive for with this car, shes 23 years old and in great shape I plan to keep her like this for a long time too.

So to solve my rust issue on the fender I used the paint/chemical Por-15. THis is a special paint that helps prevent and stop the rust.

Both fenders got the Por15 treatment and I'm happy with the result. I'll check on these in about 2 years to see if the rust has accumulated at all and go from there. 
## Headlight Rewiring
Now this wasn't planned but while I had the fenders off I found an OEM hole that ran directly to the 12v rail I was using for the H4 harness of my headlights, so I figured lets send it and routed the wiring inside the fender. 
This is the basic mock up wiring job I had planned out.

and this is it while its been finished, while its not pretty its going to be hidden inside the fender creating a cleaner engine bay than what I had.

Im very happy with how this came out and it was defenitly worth trying this.

# Hood Vent Installation
Now the fun and most planned out part I had ordered these hood vents from rgr.engineering and would suggest this to anyone who wants hood vents. After removing the hood my dad and I used masking tape to protect the hood as much as we could, We also had to borrow a jigsaw from my dads friend.

next step was planning what we would be cutting. were cutting 5 holes for 5 different vents, maximum cooling and maximum pressure release

unfortentutly because I didn't take many photos during the cutting process, I just have final results of the photo
