# The New 7 Incher Drone

Today I was able to finaly get my 7' fpv drone up and flying, after about 4-5 months I was finaly able to actully get the drone to take off and rip around, however the battery I had was trashed and instantly dropped to 20v. The drone still flew for 6 minutes and that wasn't even murdering the battery that was with me chickening out on the battery life.
This drone is absolutly impresseive to fly howevere with the very puffed up 2600mah lipo this drone weights in at a whomping 44 and a half ounces. This converts to 1261 grams. This is the full weight of the drone. A full gopro hero 9, and as mentioned the 2600mah puffed battery. I have a track event for april 20th so this weekend. and I'm just realizing that the new lipos I have ordered, a 5000 mah Lipo, weighs 798grams. 

Just messured the weight of the Drone and GoPro hero 9 for 1 lbs 12.1 oz this converts to 28oz that than converts to 793 grams 
SO 793 grams + 798 grams will be a total weight of 1,591 gram.

God dam a 3.5 pound FPV drone, this should be interesting to fly. Might need to consider building a naked gopro 9 to shedd weight
