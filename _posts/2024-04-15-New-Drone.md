# The New 7-Inch Drone

Today, I finally managed to get my 7-inch FPV drone up and flying after about 4-5 months of work. However, the battery I had was in bad shape and instantly dropped to 20 volts. Despite this setback, the drone still flew for 6 minutes, and that wasn't even pushing the battery to its limits.

Flying this drone is truly impressive. However, with the very puffed-up 2600mAh LiPo battery, the drone weighs a hefty 44.5 ounces, or 1261 grams in total. This includes the full weight of the drone itself, a GoPro Hero 9, and the mentioned battery.

I have a track event scheduled for April 20th, which is this weekend, and I'm just realizing that the new LiPos I've ordered, a 5000mAh one, weigh 798 grams. 

After measuring the weight of the drone and GoPro Hero 9, it comes to 1 pound 12.1 ounces, which converts to 28 ounces or 793 grams. Adding this to the weight of the new LiPo, the total weight will be 1,591 grams.

Wow, a 3.5-pound FPV drone! This should be an interesting experience to fly. I might need to consider building a naked GoPro 9 to shed some weight.
