# The Enduro Car is No More
Unfortunately, I have some bad news. My dad and I took the enduro car to the Waterford Speedbowl for an open practice race. We filled up the tank on our way there, but once we arrived, the only thing we could smell was gas. Sure enough, when we looked under the car, we found two major leaks in the fuel tank. We are now looking to either repair or replace the fuel tank in this car and plan to run it at the demolition derby in 2024.
