### This is just going to be me making a list of attempted repairs for the drone

So the first issue of this drone was that upon arming the drone it would flip its shit and do a flip. Made sure the motor direction was correct, made sure the props were correct, and the gyro oreientation was sloid. everything was solding with those 3. after disabiling airmod I was able to get the quad to idle without offing itself. however I now have the issue of the drone desyncing mid flight.
