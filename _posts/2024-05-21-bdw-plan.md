# Planning the Drive By Wire System


## Orginal Plan Outline
The orginal plan for the miata's drive by wire upgrade was to run 
- Skunk2 Intake Manifold
- Bosch 68mm Throttle Body
- Bosch DBW Pedal Assembly
- Haltech
- DIY Wiring Harness

## New Plan
- Skunk2 Intake Manifold
- Bosch 68mm Throttle Body
- Haltech
- DIY Wiring Harness
- Honda APP

### What is Honda App
  TBH I'm not sure what the honda app is I found the term through [Justin Barrera](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1984143951912788/user/1004109046). it seems to be a really cool adapter that ill lean on later.<br>

Justin has gone through a conversion of drive-by-cable to drive-by-wire for a 1.8 Factory Intake NB. However he has decided against using the Bosch throttle body and instead use the ND miata throttle body. But I will be using the Skunk2 Intake Manifold as it flows air better due to its design.
So Justin's included a photo and upon search through his old facebook posts I was able to find that he has orginally planned to use a Mercedes pedal accelerator, but later on switched to a Honda Pedal Accelerator. This is what he refers to as [Honda APP](https://controls.is/shop/mbapps). 
upon further research i've found the part number is 37971-RBB-003. At the time of writing this the part is in the $150~$175 for the unit. I've found an amazon alternative replace for this off amazon for $40. During my testing stage I feel this would be a good option until I can confirm everythng works as intended.
