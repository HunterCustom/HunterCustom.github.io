# First Mod for the Miata - Interior Lights

The first mod I've tackled for my Miata was upgrading the factory interior bulb from the basic halogen light to a sleek LED dome light. I also swapped out my sun visors with LEDs. Let me tell you, these upgrades are a game-changer for any MX5 owner! I snagged them from [DanDak.net](https://dandak.net), and I highly recommend them. The difference in brightness and style is seriously impressive. It's a simple mod that adds a touch of modern flair to the interior while improving visibility. Trust me, your Miata will thank you for it!
