# Hosting my Own ecommerce website 
After enduring the $30/month expense with Wix.com for my ecommerce website, huntercustom.net, where I offer modded services for Nintendo Switch (and potentially Roombas), I decided I needed a cheaper option with a cleaner design that didn't scream "freshman year Hunter." Originally considering Shopify, I stumbled upon negative reviews on Reddit, citing it as overpriced and subpar. Reddit strangers pointed me towards WooCommerce, a free ecommerce extension for WordPress. WordPress, widely used for hosting various websites from blogs to stores, seemed promising. Discovering it was a simple Docker container and database, I decided to implement it on the Lenovo M900 to see what I could create.

Following an online tutorial, I managed to develop a professional and updated website over the past week. As of writing this blog post at 8:36 pm on 3/23/24, I have nearly completed everything, except for the terms and conditions and the front page. However, I've encountered some connectivity issues for users who previously visited huntercustom.net on Wix.

Regarding the WordPress transition, I also migrated domain hosting from Google Domains (no longer in service) to Cloudflare, leveraging their features like custom emails. The website now operates under hunter@huntercustom.net.

I plan to continue documenting my progress, but I'm currently exhausted from a month of 10-hour shifts. I'm also eagerly awaiting a response from East Hartford Public Schools for a potential third interview.
