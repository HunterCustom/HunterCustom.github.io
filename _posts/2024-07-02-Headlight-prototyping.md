# Headlight Protyping... Again

Alright so looking to redo my foggy ass headlights as last time I did them they didn't seal properly and ruined the headlight lens so I am considering ordering brand new headlights and swapping the DRLs and MLED into the new housing
best pricing i've found so far is 

- [Passenger Side](https://www.mazdapartsconnect.com/oem-parts/mazda-lens-and-housing-passenger-side-rh-nc10510k0e?c=Zz1lbGVjdHJpY2FsJnM9aGVhZGxhbXAtY29tcG9uZW50cyZsPTUmbj1Bc3NlbWJsaWVzIFBhZ2UmYT1tYXpkYSZvPW1pYXRhJnk9MTk5OSZ0PWJhc2UmZT0xLThsLWw0LWdhcw%3D%3D) $256.11
- [Driver Side](https://www.mazdapartsconnect.com/oem-parts/mazda-headlight-lens-and-housing-nc10510l0e?c=Zz1lbGVjdHJpY2FsJnM9aGVhZGxhbXAtY29tcG9uZW50cyZsPTQmbj1Bc3NlbWJsaWVzIFBhZ2UmYT1tYXpkYSZvPW1pYXRhJnk9MTk5OSZ0PWJhc2UmZT0xLThsLWw0LWdhcw%3D%3D) $256.11

now fo looks I was talking to Matt over at [Left Lane Designs](https://leftlanedesigns.net), and he gave me this image and I won't like I wasn't a huge fan of it at first but when I considerd this setup with custom DRLs oooh dam will it look good

So what is this custom DRL you ask? Well, basicly making my own version of the BMW angle eyes

but how do we make these? well 3d printing of course, and some custom electronics
